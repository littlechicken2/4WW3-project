for add-on 2d:
i.not using different version here, only thing i can do is make all picture blury here but i dont want to.
actually i hate to doing that, sometimes, multi-compressed media ruined everyone experience when browsing, 
now we got wifi anywhere and if we really need to click one of those photo and found thats too blurry to see it clearly
thats really messy.

10mbps fiber cant load a picture?
ii.saves data, load faster, make it easier to organize.
iii blurry.
